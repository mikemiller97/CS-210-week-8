# CS-210-week-8

1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project's assignment was to build a functionable clock using C++. The clock must display time in 12-hour and 24-hour format and be settable. 

2. What did you do particularly well?

I believe I made the interactivity of the clock fairly well. I added a text that states to bring up the menu one needs to press the Esc key. This was not required but I added it to make the program more user friendly.

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I could enhance the code by making the application read the system's time and initially set itself to that. It would make the lcock more efficicent because it would not need to be set to the right time manually.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I found writing the code to interact with buttons pressed by th euser to be the most difficult. I overcame this by researaching how it is done with online tutorials and websites like stackoverflow. I will keep those tools in my support network for the future.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The previously messaged interactivity with the user's keyboard will be particiularly transferable to other projects and course work. Keyboard interactivity with an application is a fundamental concept for building applications. 

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by adding comments to describe what each segment of the code does. I also wrote the code in an efficient manner without too many extra steps with industry standard names for the variables in use.
